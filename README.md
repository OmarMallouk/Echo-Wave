###  Echo Wave is built using the following technologies:

- This project uses ReactJS for the frontend, providing a dynamic and interactive user interface.For backend services, we use Node.js and Express for a fast, scalable, and efficient server-side environment.
- The website's data is stored in MongoDB, a NoSQL database that allows for flexible storage and fast retrieval of user-generated content and AI-generated lyrics.
- For AI-powered features, we integrate TensorFlow.js and other NLP (Natural Language Processing) algorithms to analyze, score, and suggest original lyrics.
- The app uses the font ["Work Sans"](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Work+Sans) as its main font, and the design of the app adheres to the material design guidelines.
